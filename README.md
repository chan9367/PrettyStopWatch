# PrettyStopWatch

Expand the stopwatch project from this chapter so that it uses the rjust()
and ljust() string methods to “prettify” the output. Next, use the pyperclip module introduced in Chapter 6 to copy the text
output to the clipboard so the user can quickly paste the output to a text
file or email.
